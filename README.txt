Given 'Codes' folder has one Test.ipynb and one Train.ipynb. These are the files we used for testing and training the model respectively. These were written in python-Jupyter notebook.

The given model was saved in 'Trained_Model_FireNet' folder. Then this model was loaded by our python script 'real_time_detection.py' which tests the trained model on given video file.

We could also use live footage instead of the video file. This code is completely runnable on a raspberry pi device whilst maintaining a good frame rate.
